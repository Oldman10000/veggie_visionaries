# Veggie Visionaries

## About

This is my third Milestone Project for the Full Stack Software Development Diploma with Code Institute. I will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end, developing on the skills I have learned and implemented in my first two projects Happy Dogs Home and Workout Buddy. This project also requires me to implement back end functionality using Python, Flask and MongoDB.

This project is an online cookbook where users can access and share vegetarian recipes. Users will be able to see all recipes stored on the website and search by name/ingredient/cuisine. They can also register an account and log in so they can add their own recipes to the site as well as save existing ones as favourites.

The purpose is also to demonstrate to visitors that a vegetarian diet can be delicious, varied and well balanced. Information to this end is displayed to the user, providing facts and myth busting about a vegetarian diet. Users are encouraged to share their recipes and lifestyle to social media, hopefully encouraging more people to choose this diet.
