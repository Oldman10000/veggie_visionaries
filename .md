# Veggie Visionaries

## About

This is my third Milestone Project for the Full Stack Software Development Diploma with Code Institute. I will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end, developing on the skills I have learned and implemented in my first two projects Happy Dogs Home and Workout Buddy. This project also requires me to implement back end functionality using Python, Flask and MongoDB.

This project is an online cookbook where users can access and share vegetarian recipes. Users will be able to see all recipes stored on the website and search by name/ingredient/cuisine. They can also register an account and log in so they can add their own recipes to the site as well as save existing ones as favourites.

The purpose is also to demonstrate to visitors that a vegetarian diet can be delicious, varied and well balanced. Information to this end is displayed to the user, providing facts and myth busting about a vegetarian diet. Users are encouraged to share their recipes and lifestyle to social media, hopefully encouraging more people to choose this diet.

### Strategy

I want to cast as wide a net in terms of user base as possible. The website needs to be informative, visually appealing and easy to use for anyone. The user stories below are therefore relatively non specific, with broad requirements.

#### User Stories

I am a first time visitor and I want:

1. To know what the website is for
2. To be able to quickly access recipes
3. To be able to easily register an account
4. To be able to easily navigate around the site
5. To be able to use the site on all device types

I am a returning visitor/member and I want:

1. To be able to save my favourite recipes to my account
2. To be able to easily access saved recipes
3. To be able to easily add my own recipes
4. To be able to edit and delete my added recipes
5. To be able to see which recipes are highly rated/well reviewed
6. To be able to review recipes

I am the website owner and I want:

1. To encourage first time visitors to return to the site
2. To encourage visitors to consider a vegetarian diet

### Scope

#### Strategy Trade Off Table

Opportunity/Problem | Importance | Viability
--------------------|------------|-----------
Display recipes to users | 5 | 5
Allow users to create account | 5 | 5
Allow logged in users full CRUD functionality in terms of creating, reading, updating and deleting their own recipes | 5 | 5
Create an admin account which has full control over all added recipes | 4 | 5
Add information to encourage users to go Vegetarian | 4 | 4
Allow logged in users to leave a review | 4 | 4
Display nutritional information for each dish | 3 | 2
Hover over ingredients in instructions to get quantity | 3 | 2

The website is built as a Minimum Viable Product, but with room for expansion. I will briefly mention the main features as well as potential 'nice to haves' below.

The core functionality is for a user to be able to log in/log out and be able to Create/Read/Edit/Delete recipes. There is also an admin account which has full control over all recipes, being able to edit and delete anything, while users are only able to edit/delete their own added recipes. A logged in user can leave a review with a rating for any recipe. The average rating from each review is used to calculate the mean average for each recipe. A logged in user can also add any recipe to their 'favourites' which they can view at any time. Recipes are sorted by both difficulty and cuisine. Information is provided on the home page to encourage a user to consider including more vegetarian meals in their diet.

There are a few features which would be nice to have, however are not included at this time. These are things which I would like to return to in future once I have more technical skills under my belt.

Firstly, nutritional information for each recipe would be useful information for any user to see. However, this may be difficult to implement on a site such as this, where users are able to add their own recipes. For example, a user may want to add a recipe for a spaghetti bolognese - while a user ought to know the ingredients/steps involved in preparing this dish, it is unreasonable to expect them to also know the nutritional stats for the meal and to also include this information. Also, as a user, you aren't going to want this extra complication when using the website. A potential solution is to add all 'potential' ingredients to the mongo database as a collection, with each ingredient having nutritional information included. The user could then use a drop down list when creating the recipe to find the ingredients they need, and when the recipe is generated the nutritional information will already be present. A similar feature exists in dietary apps such as myfitnesspal. However for a small scale project like this, it is impractical for me to add nutritional information for potentially hundreds of ingredients so this is unviable at this time. In future I will look into solutios such as perhaps finding an API which stores hundreds of food ingredients nutritional data which may be a quicker way to get the info needed.

Another useful feature would be for the user to be able to hover over ingredients in the instructional steps of a recipe and for a tooltip to appear showing the quantity. For example, if an instructional step for a recipe states 'mix the flour, eggs and milk to create a batter', a user could hover over the word for each ingredient to find out the quantity needed, rather than having to scroll back up to the ingredients section every time. This is difficult to implement, again as the users are adding the recipe data themselves. I wonder if it is practical to add a function which searches through each word in the 'instructions' steps to find a matching ingredient and quantity. In a static website where all the information is added server side, this could be done quite easily and would be a nice feature for a recipe site.

### Structure

Due to the nature of the site, there are several pages that the user can access on the website. Therefore it is very important that navigation is made as easy as possible. There is a navbar at the top of every page, which takes a user to all of the pages they can access. If a user is unable to access a particular page, then a link to that page is not displayed. For example, a user that is not logged in is not provided a link to the 'add recipe' page, as this is a feature that is only usable to logged in users. Equally, a logged in user is not provided with a link to the 'login' page, as they are already logged in. If for whatever reason a user attempts to access a page that they should not have access to through the url, then they are unable to access the primary function of that page. For example, if a non logged in user enters the url for 'add recipe', the page content informs them that they need to be logged in in order to add a recipe, and the links to log in and register are provided. If a logged in user enters the url for the login page, the page content informs them that they are already logged in. A user is never trapped in a place and there is always an option to either return home, or to another section. 

There are several elements included which help a user navigate around the website. As well as the top navbar, on smaller devices I have also included a footer navbar which features icons for links to relevant pages. This is similar to mobile apps like Instagram and Reddit. Having a footer navbar on mobile is better UX as it reduces the amount of clicks needed (as opposed to a hamburger menu), and the bottom of the screen is generally easier to access than the top of the screen for a user. However, the top navbar with hamburger icon is still included. The main index screen differs from the rest of the website, as there is a large hero banner above the navbar with the most important links displayed in the centre of the window. A user can immediately navigate to the most important pages, e.g. login page, or the 'all recipes' page.

Links and other interactive elements are clearly signposted. Button text changes colour upon hover - there is also a colour scheme used where 'add' or 'open' style buttons are coloured green, while 'delete' style buttons are coloured dark orange. Cards that are used as links increase slightly in scale upon hover, as do the top navigation links. Any inline anchor tags within headings or paragraphs are bold within their respective text.

Most visual components included in the site take liberal advantage of the Material Design for Bootstrap library. Not only is this library very useful in terms of responsive design and layout, the components are designed to be visually appealing e.g. the form inputs, cards and accordion as used in this site.

### Skeleton

Below the wireframes created in advance of starting the project. The wireframing software [Figma](figma.com) was used for this as this is easy to use, and gives an excellent approximation of the final appearance of the website.

* Mobile Wireframe
  ![Wireframe for Mobile](documentation/wireframes/Phone_Wireframe.jpg)

* Tablet Wireframe
  ![Wireframe for Tablet](documentation/wireframes/Tablet_Wireframe.jpg)

* Desktop Wireframe
  ![Wireframe for Desktop](documentation/wireframes/Desktop_Wireframe.jpg)

For the most part, I stuck quite rigidly to these designs to begin with, but as can be seen on the final website, some changes were made. For example, the main hero image is no longer a plain green background with a few svg vegetables included. After receiving user feedback, it was decided that this looked a little boring so this was replaced with a large photograph of vegetables which is much more visually appealing for a user.

### Surface

For the colour scheme I used [Colourmind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/). This was an excellent tool as the website shows you the appearance of the colour pallette on a mock website.

#F0EBEF light 'off-white' - used as card background colour and for text colour for darker backgrounds
#008100 dark green - used for buttons, card background and navbar
#87B679 light green - main background body colour
#AAFFB4 lighter green - navbar footer to make this stand out
#1D261E dark grey - text colour on dark backgrounds
#FFD700 gold - stars
#FF8C00 dark orange - 'delete' buttons

![Colour Pallette](documentation/veggie-pallette.png)

The only image baked into the website is the main hero image as mentioned in above in the 'Skeleton' section. The image is eye catching and instantly tells the user what the website is for without any text content needed.

Initially, as shown on the wireframes, I had intended to use the fonts 'Amatic SC' for the headings and 'Indie Flower' for the paragraphs. I felt the handwritten style fitted well within the context of a recipe page. However, after user feedback it was decided that it was difficult to read and looked somewhat amateurish. In the end I settled on 'Josefin Sans' for headings and 'Raleway' for the paragraphs as these are both distinctive texts, yet are clean and easy to read.

## Database Model

For this project the NoSQL database MongoDB was used. Within the database for this project I made four collections. Recipes, users, reviews and cuisines.

### Recipes

This concerns all recipes in the database and includes all details as entered by the user.

## Features

I will go through the site features by page, displaying possible features for a 'non-logged in' user, a logged in user and the admin user. For brevity, I will henceforth refer to a 'non-logged in' user as 'loggedout' and a logged in user as 'loggedin'. All screenshots will be the desktop version of the site as the functionality is the same for all devices.

### Navbar

The navbar content differs depending on whether the user is loggedin or loggedout.

* Loggedout - Links to home, all recipes, cuisines, to register and to log in.
![loggedout-nav](documentation/images/loggedout-nav.jpg)

* Loggedin - Links to home, user favourites, all recipes, to add a recipe, cuisines and to log out. This is the same for the admin account.
![loggedin-nav](documentation/images/loggedin-nav.jpg)

### Index Page

Upon opening the main index page, the user is greeted by a large hero image displaying bowls of vegetables with a floating card above the image. The card contains the website name, a small text 'A place to share your favourite veggie meals!' and links to the most important pages on the site. There is also an arrow button below the links, informing the user there is more content below.

* Loggedout - index hero image. Links take the user to browse all recipes, to register or to log in.
![loggedout-hero](documentation/images/loggedout-home.jpg)

* Loggedin - index hero image. Links take the user to browse all recipes, to add a recipe or to log out. There is also a welcome text for the user. This is the same for the admin account.
![loggedin-hero](documentation/images/loggedin-nav.jpg)

Below the main hero banner, there is further content. For all users, cards display information encouraging a user to 'go veggie', the option to search for a recipe, and a list of the top 5 rated recipes. Loggedout user can login from here, while loggedin can view their favourited recipes. This is the same for the admin account.

* Loggedout
![loggedout-home](documentation/images/loggedout-dash.jpg)

* Loggedin
![loggedin-home](documentation/images/loggedin-dash.jpg)

### Recipes Page

This page displays all recipes added to the website. This looks roughly the same for all users, with some small differences if one is logged in, logged out or an admin which I will describe in more detail when necessary. First, I will describe the functions all users can operate.

#### Recipe Filters

The default display of the page is to display all recipes in descending order, with the most recently added recipe first. There are various ways a user can filter or sort the recipes as well as search. The user can also see which (if any) filters are applied.

![filters](documentation/images/filters.jpg)

##### Pagination

The page makes use of Flask's pagination module, so only 5 recipes are displayed at a time. The user is shown at the top of the page how many recipes there are in total, as well as which page they are currently on.

##### Search

The user can search through the database for any word contained in a recipe document within the recipe collection. For example, most obviously a user can search for the name of a recipe. They can also search for an ingredient or for the name of a recipe creator. The search results are shown in a seperate page. From here a user can either view the recipes or return to the main recipes page.

![search results](documentation/images/searchresults.jpg)

##### Filters

There are two filters a user can use for the recipes. Difficulty and cuisine. The difficulty options are baked into the website as 'easy', 'medium' and 'hard' and the user must choose one of these options when creating a recipe. The cuisines are taken from the database and can be added/deleted by the site admin from the website. These features will be discussed in more detail later. Both filters can be used in conjunction with each other, e.g. a user can filter by Easy/Mexican, Medium/Chinese recipes etc. Alternatively, each filter can be individually reset to display 'all' recipes, e.g. to show Easy/All, All/Chinese etc.

##### Add Recipe

If the user is logged in, there is also a button prompting them to add a new recipe.

![filters logged in](documentation/images/filtersloggedin.jpg)

##### Sort

A user can sort the displayed recipes into different orders, I have included 4 options with the default being newest first. The other 3 options are A-Z, Rating (top rated first) and Oldest First. Sorting can be done even when recipes are filtered.

##### Reset

The orange reset button resets the page to display all recipes in newest order, and can be operated at any time.

#### Recipes List

As stated above, by default all recipes are shown in descending order. The most important information for each recipe is displayed alongside an image of the recipe (if applicable). If no image url is to be found in the database, there is a default blank 'camera' icon which displays instead. If the current session user is the recipe creator or admin, they have the option to edit and delete their recipe from this screen.

* Loggedout - when user is logged out, only the information is displayed. User can select either 'view recipe' or click on the image to open up more info to the recipe.
![loggedout-recipes](documentation/images/loggedout-recipes.jpg)

* Logged in - when user is logged in, their added recipes have the option to edit/delete their recipe as well. As can be seen below, the session user is 'elvis' and is able to edit/delete this recipe.
![loggedin-recipes](documentation/images/loggedin-recipes.jpg)
As can be seen below, this recipe was not created by 'elvis', and therefore cannot be edited/deleted by this user.
![loggedin-recipes2](documentation/images/loggedin-recipes2.jpg)
If the logged in user is 'admin', then full control over edit/delete functions on this page

### Recipe Page

The page which displays all recipes has several sections.

1. Recipe info - this displays all the same information as displayed on its card on the 'all recipes' page. A logged in user also has the option to add the recipe to their 'favourites'. More info will be given on this functionality later on.
![recipe-info](documentation/images/recipeinfo-loggedin.jpg)

2. A list of ingredients for this recipe in an unorderd list format.
![ingredients](documentation/images/ingredients.jpg)

3. A list of instructions for this recipe in an ordered list format.
![instructions](documentation/images/instructions.jpg)

4. Review Form
  - If a user is logged in, an 'add review' form.
    ![review-form](documentation/images/reviewform.jpg)
  - If the session user is the recipe creator, they cannot review the recipe as their opinion would presumably be somewhat biased.
    ![user-revier](documentation/images/userreview.jpg)
  - If user is loggedout, this form is not visible and the user is prompted to log in or  register to leave a review.
    ![review-loggedout](documentation/images/reviewloggedout.jpg)

5. A list of all reviews for this recipe in order of newest first. Reviewer username, date, time, rating and review text is displayed.
![reviews](documentation/images/reviews.jpg)

### Favourites

If a user is logged in, they can add and view their favourite recipes. A recipe can be added to favourites as described above, from the recipe page. A user can add their own added recipes to favourites as well, as there is no reason they shouldn't be allowed to like their own meals. Upon selecting the favourite 'heart' icon, the user is redirected to their favourites page. The favourites page shows a list of the user's favourites, and from here the user can either access the recipe's page or remove the recipe from their favourites.
![favorites](documentation/images/favorites.jpg)
A recipe can also be removed from the user's favourites from the recipe page by selecting the same 'heart' icon on a favourited recipe.

### Cuisines

Recipes are sorted by cuisine. Site users can visit the 'cuisines' page which lists all cuisines that have been added. These are shown in list format on cards, which display the cuisine name and an appropriate image. Only the site admin has the power to add/delete cuisines.
  - If current user is not admin - same for loggedin and loggedout
    ![cuisines](documentation/images/cuisines.jpg)
  - If current user is admin. From here admin can also add cuisines (name and photo), and delete cuisines.
    ![cuisines-admin](documentation/images/cuisinesadmin.jpg)
If the admin deletes a cuisine and there are recipes in the database which have this cuisine name as their cuisine, their cuisine is changed to 'other' automatically. For example if we have the recipe 'Pizza' on the database withe the cuisine 'Italian', if admin deletes the 'Italian' cuisine, 'Pizza's cuisine will be changed to 'other'.

### Add Recipe

Any logged in user can add a recipe. This is done from the 'add recipe' page. If loggedout attempts to reach this page, they are prompted to log in. The form itself has several fields which update the recipe collection in the database when submitted.

![add-recipe](documentation/images/addrecipe.jpg)

1. Recipe Name - adds recipe name
2. Cuisine - select menu which takes all cuisines from the cuisines collection. Default option is 'other'
3. Difficulty - user must select recipe difficulty from easy/medium/hard. Easy by default.
4. Prep Time - adds prep time
5. Cook Time - adds cook time
6. Serves - adds people served
7. Description - short description of the recipe max 250 char
8. Ingredients (max 20) - user can add up to 20 ingredients. By default only one input is shown, but it is easy for the user to add further inputs as needed using the 'add another ingredient' button. If the user changes their mind, the last input can be deleted just as easily.
9. Instruction Steps (max 10) - this works in much the same way as the ingredient inputs
10. Add photo - uses a Cloudinary widget to upload a photo to the Cloudinary storage on my account. Upon upload, Cloudinary generates a unique url for the image which is passed to a hidden input box on the form. Upon upload, the add photo button is removed from the window to make sure a user cannot add a second image. If an image upload is successful, there is positive feedback on the page.

Finally, the user can submit the form. Alternatively, they can cancel and this redirects the user to the recipes page.

### Edit Recipe

This functions in much the same way as the add recipe page. The appearance is identical, the only difference being that the recipe data is passed into the form by default.

![edit-recipe](documentation/images/editrecipe.jpg)

### Register

The register form is simple, asking a user for only their email address, and to create a user name and password. The password must be entered twice to confirm. The 'Register' button is inactive by default and is only available once all fields are valid. Textual information is provided upon typing in the box to help the user know when their info is valid. Once the form has been submitted, the data is added to the 'users' collection in the database and the new user is immediately logged in as the current session user. If the username is already taken, then the form submit fails and the username is alerted to this fact by a flash message.

* Empty form
![register](documentation/images/register.jpg)

* Validation
![register-validation](documentation/images/registervalidation.jpg)

### Log In

The login form is almost identical in appearance to the register screen. There are two inputs, one for username/email and one for the password. It was decided to allow users to login using either their username or email as we often don't remember our usernames and the email address is a simple alternative which appears to have become a web standard for login forms. Upon successful login the user is added to the session cookie.
